export saved state to execute on firefly

run on Cortex M0
gate big core off

disable most power domains

get I2C working
tell RK808 and other power reg to turn off stuff

by this point, we should be somewhat close to power consumption
might try disabling DDR for fun to see how low we go

~~~

set constraints on:
	- vcodec needs to be about 400MHz
	- serial port needs to be whatever it needs to be
	- ISP also about 400MHz
